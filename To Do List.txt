1) Make a 16 x 16 grid of divs using JS.  Will probably need to use a "do While" loop for this.

2) Make the grid inside one large "box" container

3) Make a hover effect that changes the color of the boxes (Random color 256 ex)

4) MAke a popup asking the user to change the number of squares per side (ie 10 x 10 grid , 22 x 22 grid) that uses the same total pixel space as the prior grid (960 px x 960...will need to have a function that devides the pixels by desired dimensions to calculate square size)




function makeDivs(side, tailLengt){
let side = s;
    each box needs to be (960px/side dimension) divs wide and high (need to find a rounding % solution)
(make box of divs s * s)
insert these divs into grid container div
}

//Hover Effect
Make each box class have an event listener for mousehover
let mouse hover select a random RGB value 0-256

//tail effect
Have a "teil length" function that allows the user to select how long they want to make the "tail".  MAx will need to be grid surface area, and need a function to delete every tail pixel decending after user input
